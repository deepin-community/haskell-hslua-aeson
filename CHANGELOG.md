# Changelog

`hslua-aeson` uses [PVP Versioning][].

## hslua-aeson-2.1.0

Released 29-01-2022.

-   Update to hslua 2.1.

-   Encode `null` as light userdata: The `NULL` pointer wrapped
    into a light userdata is used to encode the JSON null value.

    The `pushNull` function has been removed; use
    `pushValue Null` instead.

-   Types that are instances of `ToJSON` and `FromJSON` can be
    marshalled/unmarshalled by using the new functions
    `pushViaJSON` and `peekViaJSON`, respectively.

-   The functions `peekVector`, `pushVector`, `peekScientific`,
    `pushScientific`, `peekKeyMap`, and `pushKeyMap` are
    considered an implementation detail and are no longer
    exported.

-   Array elements are now marked with a metatable. This avoids
    the need for an extra `0` element in the table and offers
    flexibility for users who want to give special behavior to
    lists. The newly exported value `jsonarray` contains the name
    of the registry slot under which the metatable is stored. The
    table can be modified or replaced as required.

## hslua-aeson-2.0.0

-   The Peekable and Pushable instances have been removed. The
    package no longer defines orphaned instances.

-   Updated hslua and aeson to the respective 2.0 version.

## hslua-aeson-1.0.3.1

## hslua-aeson-1.0.1

Released 2020-04-03

-   Relax version constraint for packages hashable and hslua,
    allow `hashable-1.3` and `hslua-1.1.*`.

## hslua-aeson-1.0.0

Released 2019-09-24.

-   Update to hslua 1.0.0

-   Function `registerNull` has been replaced by `pushNull`.

    Using `pushNull` has the advantage that users wonâ€™t have to
    remember to register a special variable. Users who need a
    global variable can set it by running

          pushNull
          setglobal "HSLUA_AESON_NULL"
